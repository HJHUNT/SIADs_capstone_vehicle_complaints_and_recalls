       "      <td id=\"T_a5ee8_row9_col0\" class=\"data row9 col0\" >There appears to be a model-wide problem with 2017 Honda Accord audio system that manifests in screeching static noise through audio speakers (whether the radio is turned on or not) at decibels in excess of 100 (sounds like a lawnmower being operated inside a closed 4 door sedan). This noise comes with no warning (or waring lights) and shocks the senses that can cause erratic vehicle operation. Once the noise starts, it will last varying lengths of time that include in excess of 12 minutes. The only means to make it stop is by turning off the car, which is not easy or safe if highway driving. The screeching is so loud, it is impossible to hear emergency sirens or honking horns, making this a serious safety issue. This is also very distracting -- imagine a passenger screaming in your ear as loud as they can non-stop -- simply not conducive to safe driving! Honda of America acts like they have never heard of this issue (I can see that many, many 2017 Accord owners have reported this very issue over the last several years). Dealer diagnostics reveal nothing. They only recommend replacing the entire audio head unit ($4K) and owner expense. For a car that is only 7 years old, it is not working as intended. A recall seems warranted. This has been going on over a month now and is getting progressively worse. Please help us. [XXX] Please open this video to hear the problem.

If this fails during sharp turns, there is chance of damaging my own car and even other cars putting others and myself into safety risk. There are no warning lamps and messages. The problem first appeared after 5-7 days after the purchase; however, I thought the car is new and being adjusted for the ride with the huge 21 inch tires it has. Additionally, the car has problem with suspension, after a ride and when placing it in park mode, the suspension of the car swings enabling the car to move forward and backward possibly hitting the car infront or back damaging the other cars too.</td>\n",
