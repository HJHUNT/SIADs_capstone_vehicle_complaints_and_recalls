Lookup of complaints on the NHTSA public website are unaffected.\n",

The complaint data is included in the single FLAT_CMPL.zip and the COMPLAINTS_RECEIVED_YYYY-YYYY.zip files, which contain the same data broken down into 5-year chunks by received date. Note that the format of the complaint files has not and will not change.
